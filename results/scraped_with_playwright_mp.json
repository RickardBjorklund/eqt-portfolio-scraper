        "description":"AboutAnticimex is one of the top global players in the pest control market and is the leading player in the digitally-enabled pest control market with its SMART offering.The company was established in 1934, and the Group has since then experienced uninterrupted growth, powered both by strong organic performance and high M&A activity. Anticimex today operates close to 200 branches across Europe, Asia, Pacific, North America and Latin America with a focus on pest control services, but also offers certain additional complementary services in selected markets, including hygiene and building environment services. Anticimex also offers pest control and building environment services through insurance arrangements in Europe.Anticimex' business model is built on service and insurance contracts, creating stable and recurring revenues. The mission is to provide customers with “peace of mind” and a pest free indoor environment with preventative pest control solutions.Impact AnglePest infestations are detrimental to society by contaminating food, spreading disease and causing economic losses. Thus, pest control is vital to keeping societies healthy and reducing societal, environmental and economic costs caused by infestations.Anticimex is leading the transformation of the industry towards digital and preventative pest control. Its sensor-based solution Anticimex SMART detects when a pest infestation is about to happen and can also predict where it might happen next, thus maximizing prevention and minimizing the negative impact of pests. It is also toxin-free and hence has no impact on natural ecosystems and lowers GHG emissions as unnecessary trips are eliminated.EQT Future’s theory of change is therefore one where Anticimex transforms traditional pest control to a sustainable industry which does not use toxic substances, protects ecosystems, prevents waste and minimises emissions - aligned with the fund’s Planet objective.Market Trends and DriversThe pest control market is supported by a number of structural growth drivers, including increasing pest prevalence due to urbanization, globalization and climate change as well as decreasing societal tolerance of pests due to cultural change, increased purchasing power and increasing health and safety regulation. The market is also fragmented with large consolidation potential. Anticimex is well-positioned to capitalise on these drivers through its global platform, best in class service offering and decentralised operating model.Investment PotentialEQT Future will support Anticimex in its next growth phase with a focus on continuing EQT VI’s proven value creation model while accelerating positive impact by leading the sustainable transformation of the industry.Value creation will remain focused on sustaining strong organic growth, continued M&A execution and international expansion. In terms of leading the sustainable transformation of the industry, focus will be on accelerating the roll-out of Anticimex’ digital solution SMART and scaling it globally.",

Artwall is headquartered in Shanghai and has one of the world’s largest flexible production bases in Jiangsu Province with digital print-on-demand technology.Market trends and driversArtwall targets fast growing but fragmented China wallcovering market. Increasing wallpaper penetration ratio, more frequent renovation cycle and higher ASP through introduction of innovative new products will drive continuous future growth.Continued rising disposable income accelerates consumption upgrade in China. With improving living conditions and rising demand for more artistic and eco-friendly decoration solutions, wallpaper is becoming more and more popular among Chinese households. Moreover, aging home and houses built during the 1990s (first decade of Chinese Real Estate commercialization period) are entering a renovation period, which further drives the market growth. Lastly, the China wallpaper market is fragmented with top 10 players representing only one third of market share. The market leaders like Artwall will benefit most from the industry consolidation trend.Investment potentialGiven its strong product offering, creative in-house design capability and industry leading flexible digital print-on-demand technology, Artwall is well-positioned to capture the growth opportunities in the under-penetrated wallpaper market in China and benefit from the increasing trend of more frequent home and house renovations.EQT will support the company through further expansion of product offering to transform the company into a fully-integrated soft decoration solution provider. EQT will also support the company to consolidate the industry via value accretive acquisitions. In September 2018, Artwall announced the acquisition of Brewster’s China business. Brewster, founded in 1935, is the leading US wallpaper brand and has been a well-established premium brand in China for more than 20 years.",

The company uses direct clearing access through blue-chip partner banks to serve the fast-growing online payment processing provider market. Banking Circle has around 150 employees and was processing run-rate annual payments volumes of approximately EUR 60 billion.Market trends and driversTraditional cross border payment processing, using several correspondent banks, can be inefficient for fast-growing online payment processing providers. In addition, banks and FinTechs are increasingly focusing on the consumer- and merchant-facing part of the value chain and want to reduce their infrastructure complexity. Banking Circle provides a one-stop-platform for processing cross border payments. Barriers to entry are high and Banking Circle has established close partnerships with clearing banks and customers in a conservative industry with complex regulations.Investment potentialHighly scalable platform and business model. Going forward, EQT will support the continued acceleration of Banking Circle’s growth strategy, as well as the expansion of the product portfolio.",

Headquartered in the UK, it was formed in 2023 through the combination of two fruit breeders: SNFL, founded in 1992, and IFG, founded in 2001. The company is a truly global breeding business with a footprint in 22 countries.The Companies’ teams of geneticists, molecular biologists, agronomists and technologists have developed innovative new patented table grape and cherry varieties for over three decades. In addition to being more resistant to disease, which reduces the need for harmful fungicides, the grapes and cherries are more durable and resistant, have higher yields, have more consistent taste, and have higher nutritional values than legacy varieties. BLOOM has developed significant expertise in innovative fruit breeding, creating broad gene banks that form the foundation for the evolution of new varieties.Market trends and driversBLOOM sits in EQT Future’s prioritized sub-sector of FoodTech. The fruits genetics space is well positioned to benefit from the secular ‘agriculture tech’ wave, which is driven by the need for increased agricultural yields and disease immunity and evolving consumer preferences. Fruit genetics sits in one of the most attractive positions in the food value chain due to the high R&D-intensity and licensing business model, which creates downside protected businesses with strong earning visibility.Investment potential The investment in BLOOM echoes EQT Future’s commitment to fostering industries that champion positive change. The combined company has an excellent track record and potential to continue to transform the fruit industry. BLOOM’s varieties  provide higher yield for farmers, better fruit flavor and texture to enhance customer experience, and improve economics for retailers by ensuring longer shelf life and ability to differentiate.In accordance with EQT Future’s impact-driven strategy, EQT will support the development of disease-resistant varieties that reduces the need for fungicide use in the growing process, providing a solution for one of the grape industry’s biggest environmental challenges. Furthermore, BLOOM will leverage EQT's inhouse digital and tech expertise, global presence and network of advisors to strengthen their systems and organizations.",

The core of Bluestep’s business is to take the time to understand each individual situation, focusing on future potential rather than standardized processes identifying obstacles in the shape of credit history, employment forms and income. Through responsible yet inclusive mortgages customers should have the opportunity to improve their financial circumstances, both long term and short term.Bluestep has a multifaceted product line, all with the common denominator of mortgages, including specialist mortgages in Sweden, Norway and Finland, equity release loans through 60plusbanken in Sweden, and second charge loans in Norway. The bank also offers retail deposits. Headquartered in Stockholm with offices in Oslo and Helsinki, Bluestep has approximately 250 employees and is under supervision of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.Market trends and driversThe specialist mortgage segment is expecting double-digit growth driven by strong secular trends and increasing requirements on traditional banking combined with significant untapped potential remaining for specialist mortgages.

Bluestep is thereby well-positioned to benefit from these secular trends.Moreover, Bluestep is operating in the attractive underlying Nordic credit market which is characterized by sound macroeconomic conditions, a high degree of digitization, a data-rich environment and a well-functioning legal and collection framework.Investment PotentialBluestep is a leader in the Nordic specialist mortgage segment and has unique capabilities to serve this growing and important customer group in a responsible way.

With improving living conditions and rising disposable income in China, property owners and managers are looking for more comprehensive and high-quality property management services.Moreover, outsourcing penetration in China is low compared to both developing and developed countries, providing room for further penetration. The increasing outsourcing rate in China is driven by facility management service providers offering better service quality, cost efficiency and integrated solutions.Lastly, the China facility management market is highly fragmented with top 8 players only representing 4% of market share. Ongoing consolidation is expected to present further growth opportunities.Investment potentialGiven its high customer advocacy, proven track record and management team being one of the most experienced in the sector, China Shine is well-positioned to capture the attractive and structural growth in the China facility management market.EQT is excited to support the continued growth of the company through further expansion into service offerings such as specialized cleaning, pest control, security and hardware maintenance which will add depth to the current portfolio, increase margins and improve client stickiness. The business plan also calls for expansion in geographical coverage and further penetration in the existing geographical footprint.China Shine intends to accelerate growth and consolidate the industry via value accretive acquisitions. The buy-and-build strategy will further supplement the Company’s service offerings and support its ambition to become a leading national fully-integrated facility management service platform.",

        "description":"Founded in 1992, Covanta is the world’s leading waste to energy company, providing an environmentally sustainable solution for waste disposal. Covanta’s 41 waste to energy (“WtE”) facilities process and convert ~22mm tons of waste into enough renewable energy to power one million homes annually, while its 16 material processing facilities (“MPFs”) process an additional 700k tons of profiled waste for recycling and assured destruction per year. The company’s operations generate more than 10 million megawatt hours (“MWh”) of baseload electricity and recover 600,000 tons of metals.Covanta is the clear leader in a very stable industry that is underpinned by long-term contracts, high barriers to entry, and positive tailwinds related to sustainability advantages versus landfills. The company has an expansive national footprint serving more than 3,000 municipal and industrial customers with approximately 4,000 dedicated employees. Covanta is a mission-driven company, focused on being a leading sustainable waste solutions provider in an increasingly circular economy.Market Trends and DriversThe waste management market is very stable and steadily growing at a similar rate to GDP and population growth. Within waste management, sustainable solutions such as Covanta’s are enjoying regulatory tailwinds due to restrictive emission standards on landfills and higher customer demand driven by municipal and corporate initiatives such as “zero-waste-to-landfill” and circular economy goals. Landfill moratoriums in states such as Massachusetts and New York are increasing the competitive moat for waste to energy and recycling, underscoring the essential nature of Covanta’s asset base. Demand from industrial clients to satisfy their emerging ESG goals has also been steadily climbing as companies prioritize more sustainable waste solutions for the environment.Investment PotentialThe Covanta investment is highly thematic to the EQT franchise, facilitating EQT’s direct participation in the broader growing circular economy through sustainable waste solutions. The goal of this partnership is to continue to help the company grow and expand its positive impact on society. Key value creation opportunities include increasing profiled waste solutions, growing environmental solutions business, increasing recycling of metals, optimizing plant operations, and strengthening leading ESG focus.

Cypress Creek is a mission-driven company, focused on developing cost-competitive renewable energy and powering a green and sustainable future, one project at a time.Market Trends and DriversRenewables’ share of US energy generation continues to swiftly increase and is expected to outgrow conventional energy, driven by regulatory support, technology cost decline, and corporate offtake demand. The recent passing of the USD 1.2 trillion US federal infrastructure bill, which included the largest investment in clean energy transmission and the electric grid in US history, underscores the momentum of US policy support behind clean energy solutions.

Today the company is Germany‘s leading FTTH platform with a best-in-class roll-out machine in place.inexio was founded by David Zimmer in 2007 and has since the start invested heavily in fiber infrastructure in rural and small-town communities in Germany, predominantly in the Southwestern and Southern parts.The combined company is Germany's leading FTTH platform and is today already offering fiber-based high-speed internet access to more than 1 million households and businesses in rural Germany.Market trends and driversGermany is one of the most attractive growth markets for fiber in Europe as the penetration rates are significantly lower than in other countries. Specifically, in 2019 only 9% of German households had access to an FTTH internet connection compared to 73% in Sweden and 36% in the Netherlands. As demand for bandwidth is expected to increase strongly driven primarily by rising data volumes and the growth of video streaming, the German government announced its plan to provide universal Gigabit internet access.Investment potentialThe combined group is committed to continue rolling out a large-scale FTTH network that is expected to bring high-speed internet connectivity to 6 million rural and suburban German households by 2030, which represents a significant share of the German government’s plan to provide universal Gigabit internet access. The planned roll-out will be supported by the group’s best-in-class roll-out machine and its unique existing backbone and metro network. Besides this comprehensive B2C agenda, the company will also focus on strengthening its existing B2B business.",

        "description":"About EncyclisHeadquarted in the UK, Encyclis provides energy-from-waste services which turn residual waste into low-carbon electricity, heat and other reusable materials. Formerly known as Covanta Europe, its state-of-the-art energy recovery facilities support the transition to a circular economy by making productive use of residual waste that would otherwise go to landfill. With expertise stretching back over three decades, extensive partnerships and continuous innovation, Encyclis provides a progressive solution for waste management which accelerates the journey to net-zero.Market trends & driversUK and EU policy is based on a “waste hierarchy” mechanism where energy recovery is preferred for waste that cannot be recycled – “residual waste”.In the UK, the introduction of landfill tax has spurred UK EfW development over the past decade towards an equilibrium of waste supply and incineration capacity in the medium term. The capacity gap between EfW capacity and residual waste supply still exists although based on known construction projects this is set to reduce through the decade. One of the key value levers for Encyclis is to secure development projects as the UK market tightens.In Ireland, Encyclis’ Dublin plant is the only facility in the Dublin vicinity and critical to the treatment of Irish waste. Without this plant, substantial volumes of non-recyclable Irish waste would need to be sent abroad or to landfill.Investment PotentialEncyclis is the result of the legal separation of Covanta’s European operations from Covanta Holdings Corporation (EQT Infrastructure V portfolio company). This separation provides a unique opportunity to develop a standalone European EfW platform and unlock its core value by successfully delivering under construction facilities to operation and consolidating Encyclis as a leading operator in the UK and Ireland. EQT Infrastructure, through its purpose-driven investment approach, is supporting Encyclis to drive sustainable waste processing and enable transitions to a circular economy, playing a key role in empowering and supporting the UK and Ireland’s ambitions towards net zero.",

        "description":"Envirotainer was established in 1985 and is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. The company is a global market leader in air transport of temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals. With the world's largest fleet of specialized containers and close collaboration with airlines and freight forwarders, Envirotainer meets the pharmaceutical industry's complex need for fast and safe cold chain shipments where the pharmaceutical maintains exactly the right temperature throughout transport - from factory to end user.Biological drugs are very temperature sensitive and large values are lost every year due to shortcomings in the logistics chain. Envirotainer's solutions provide the opportunity to meet complex and regulatory requirements when transporting these medicines under controlled temperatures. Thus, the company has a key role to play in ensuring that vital treatments, such as vaccines, insulin and oncological drugs, reach patients safely. Envirotainer delivered two million doses of medication every day in 2021.Market trends and driversEnvirotainer is uniquely positioned as the market leader and industry gold standard, in a highly attractive, resilient and strongly growing niche market with exposure to the underlying biopharma market. The market growth is supported by secular trends such as growing and aging global population, stricter pharma regulatory requirements and innovation of pharma products requiring cold chain solutions.Millions of people across the globe depend on the safe delivery of biopharmaceuticals that require temperature control to maintain their integrity and quality. Today, lack of access to medicines is a cause for distress that disproportionately impacts underserved communities, whose situation is likely to be exacerbated by chronic diseases resulting from changing diets and lifestyles, as well as from air and water pollution. Envirotainer expands access to vital pharmaceuticals and vaccines through its patient-safe, reliable and efficient cold chain solutions, which also offer one of the lowest carbon footprint solutions in the industry.Investment potentialEQT Private Equity will support Envirotainer in its next phase of growth by accelerating expansion in APAC and further driving growth in its other core markets, while investing behind new technology innovations, digitalization and sustainability in its operations.",

Deployment will take place exclusively in Flanders and focus on the suburban areas of the region. The JV Partners are committed to supporting the company in creating a best-in-class roll-out machine to ensure that fiber connectivity can be offered to households from as early as 2021.Market Trends and DriversBelgium is one of the most attractive growth markets for fiber in Europe as the penetration rates are significantly lower than in other European countries. Specifically, in 2019 only 7% of Belgian households had access to an FTTH internet connection compared to 77% in Sweden and 45% in the Netherlands. At the same time demand for bandwidth is expected to continue increasing strongly driven primarily by rising data volumes and the growth of use cases such as video streaming and remote working.Enabling future-proof and reliable broadband access thus becomes more and more important and the JV will make an important contribution to facilitating digital inclusion and sustainable economic growth.Investment PotentialFiberklaar is committed to roll out a large-scale, open access FTTH network that will provide fiber connectivity to at least 1.5 million households and small businesses in the Flemish Region of Belgium. The company will be able to leverage the unique combination of EQT Infrastructure’s vast experience from developing strong fiber companies in Europe and North America and Proximus’ unrivalled expertise in the Belgian telecom market. Fiberklaar will drive network utilization on the back of superior infrastructure offering and favourable speed-independent pricing available to all service providers.",

First Transit operates a comprehensive portfolio of complementary public transportation services on behalf of cities, municipalities, and businesses, including fixed route buses and trains, paratransit services, shuttle buses, outsourced vehicle maintenance and other services.Market trends and driversStudent and public transportation are critical components of the US and Canadian educational and economic ecosystems, with student success metrics and funding directly correlated to student attendance, and millions of individuals across the socioeconomic spectrum relying on public transportation daily to get to work, access healthcare, and contribute to the broader economy. As a result of the essential nature of services provided, the public transportation end market is highly stable through economic cycle and benefits from favourable tailwinds including increasing demand for outsourcing and for safer, smarter and more environmentally friendly transportation options. The growing capital intensity and operational complexity associated with digitizing operations and electrifying the fleet will place greater demand across the value chain and favor large, resource-rich outsourced providers, such as First Student and First Transit, who bring best-in-class safety, reliability, capital, and technological expertise to districts and governments.Investment potentialEQT Infrastructure is committed to building upon the success First Student and First Transit have achieved by making investments in organizational, operational, digital, and sustainability initiatives to further improve and differentiate the Company’s service offering.

        "description":"About GlobalConnectGlobalConnect was created through the merger of the Danish-Norwegian company GlobalConnect and the Swedish company IP-Only in December 2019. The group operates across B2B and B2C business segments: Through its B2B segment, operated under the brand of GlobalConnect, the business provides network-centric mission-critical communication infrastructure across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Northern Germany for enterprise customers, and through its B2C segment, operated under the brands of IP-Only in Sweden, Homenet in Norway and Onefiber in Denmark, the business provides the installation and provision of fiber network and services to urban and rural single and multi-dwelling units in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The goal of the group is to become the leading digital infrastructure provider to businesses, public institutions and consumers with comprehensive national and cross-border fiber networks and a unique position in Northern Europe.GlobalConnect is well-positioned to serve the growing demand of national and international customers. The scale of the combined organization will allow strengthened innovation and investment to bring new technologies and solutions faster to the market.In 2020, GlobalConnect had revenues of approximately EUR 581 million and employed more than 1,600 people across the Nordics and Northern Germany. The company connects more than 650,000 homes and serves approximately 30,000 enterprises.Market trends and driversThe B2B market is characterized by the digitalization megatrend, connectivity needs and increasing IT outsourcing and cloud application adoption that drives data volume growth in fixed fiber networks, mobile backhaul as well as data center usage. As a result, the growing demand for secure high-performance connectivity and data storage solutions, leads to opportunities for fiber network providers and suppliers of cloud enabling infrastructure. Additionally, growing mobile usage and increasing IP traffic demand is driving need for fiber connections to mobile sites.The demand for fiber connectivity in the B2C market is supported by increasing bandwidth needs of consumers, especially, due to the proliferation of high quality on-demand video, content streaming, etc. and is expected to continue to grow at a high pace supporting continued conversion to fiber technology.Investment potentialThe investment thesis is founded on solid infrastructure characteristics, based on the provision of a mission critical infrastructure to businesses and consumers and benefiting from a high share of recurring revenue in a non-cyclical underlying market. Further, GlobalConnect & IP-Only owns a unique and well-invested fiber network, and serves a market experiencing strong tailwind.Value creation levers include further commercialization of the existing fiber network and the acceleration of fiber build-out to capture large portions of the underlying market growth both in B2B and B2C in Northern Europe. In addition, there is value creation potential in offering enhanced end-to-end connectivity solutions to strengthen the customer proposition, focusing on operational excellence and pursuing strategic add-on acquisitions.",

The Company has built a strong reputation as a leading vertical software solution within the people photography segment across its core markets, while being bootstrapped.Market Trends and DriversGotPhoto operates in a large but highly fragmented and antiquated market, in which digital services and products are not commonly used. The volume photography market has proven to be more resilient than other parts of the wider photography market given people’s continued desire to purchase high-quality photos as a way to “capture a moment” in time, like the first day of nursery or graduation day. GotPhoto is well positioned in this market thanks to its seamless end-to-end functionality and user-friendly platform, which has allowed the Company to continue winning market share from legacy solutions.Investment potentialEQT Growth will partner with GotPhoto’s founders and management team to further invest in the Company’s proprietary tech platform while it adds new product features.

Today, ILA has over 22,000 ELT enrollments across Vietnam, and in addition offers overseas study consultancy, teacher training services and corporate English training. ILA strives to be at the forefront in delivering high quality and up-to-date programs to its students across Vietnam.Market trends and driversThe ELT market in Vietnam is highly attractive and fast-growing with significant potential given the current low ELT penetration compared to other developing countries such as China and Brazil.Rising demand for high quality ELT services in Vietnam across all age groups is driven by the lack of quantity and quality in English lessons in the public school system, the trend for students to study abroad\/in international schools, increasing the importance of English proficiency in the workplace and the growing household disposable income in Vietnam.Investment potentialEQT Mid Market is excited to support the continued growth and development of the company through enhancements of the academic product offering, learning experience and environment, and network expansion, by leveraging on EQT’s experience and network globally.With its existing brand equity, centre footprint and enrolment base, ILA is well-placed to expand into new business adjacencies, such as Mid-priced ELT, childcare \/ enrichment and test prep, and to develop beyond ELT to become a multi-service education platform in Vietnam.",

The company partners with blue chip landlords to provide turnkey charging solutions and enjoys high customer satisfaction due to its reliable nationwide network, an easy-to-use interface with contactless payment, and high availability rates. InstaVolt’s charge points are primarily situated in locations where drivers can spend their time productively, such as retail, food and beverage and leisure sites.Market trends and driversWith the UK’s target to reach net zero by 2050 and the government’s decision to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, EV penetration is expected to increase materially over the next decade. Development of national charging networks is essential for the mass adoption of EVs as lack of charging infrastructure is a key purchaser concern. Additionally, a significant share of the UK population does not have access to charging at home or in the workplace, hence development of public charging infrastructure is essential in reaching the country’s sustainability targets.Investment potentialInstaVolt represents a truly thematic investment by EQT in EV charging infrastructure. Supported by EQT, InstaVolt’s experienced management team will accelerate the ongoing rollout and thereby strengthen its already well-established charging network across the UK. EQT Infrastructure has extensive experience from multiple business models in the energy sector and will support management in their pursuit of new growth opportunities in current and new markets, drawing on EQT’s global footprint and extensive network of advisors.",

Backed by an industry leading 98% mechanical availability guarantee, Kodiak’s 24\/7 access to technical and mechanical support has helped the company create a unique and unparalleled offering, leading to strong, long-term relationships.Kodiak was founded in Houston in 2011 with multi-decade operational experience in gas compression and has grown rapidly to ~2,800,000 horsepower today. Leveraging its scale, experience and leading data analytics, Kodiak has become the preferred partner for the industry’s top operators.Market trends and driversUS crude oil production has doubled since 2008 and continues to rapidly increase, driven by advances in unconventional drilling and extraction methods. Compression, serving as critical infrastructure at every juncture in the oil and gas value chain, is poised to directly benefit from continued technological innovation and demand and supply expansion.Specifically, the market trend is moving towards the centralization of compression providing for increased duration of use and stickiness for large compressors as more wells can be tied back to a centralized site. Nearly 80% of Kodiak’s fleet is comprised of high margin, large compression.Investment PotentialKodiak’s differentiated service offering and strong commitment to customers has helped the company build a proven model for growth and profitability. The goal of this partnership is to continue to help the company expand with existing and new customers, further strengthen its technology platform and enhance Kodiak’s service offering.

By the end of 2017, Long-Spring Education had over 8,000 students on campus across seven high schools in the Yunnan Province with a focus on Chinese curriculum.Market trends and driversYunnan is a stable and large market with four million people in the high school age range. Gross enrollment rate is increasing and good quality education resources are scarce. Private education has grown vigorously with the continuous support of central and Yunnan local government policy. Private education will continue to grow further, driven by a relatively stable birth rate, improvements in the high school enrollment rate and the rise of private education penetration in the market.Investment potentialLong-Spring focuses on the mass market of mainstream Chinese curriculum under a light asset business model and has a leading position in full-time high school tutoring and retake segments. The centralized and modularized management model secures control over key resources to mitigate the reliance on school principals, therefore making it highly replicable. Long-Spring’s cooperation with the government is a win-win model, through which the government can save fiscal expenditure, speed up education coverage and improve education quality while Long-Spring can save the capital expenditure on campus and facilities.The top priority is to further grow its full-time education offerings in scale and reputation by continuously improving education quality and seeking opportunities for geographic expansion. Long-Spring will focus on utilizing M&A to drive strategic development into adjacent segments in the education sector while EQT helps introduce international curriculum it Long-Spring’s local students.",

Magnit serves a wide array of Fortune 1,000 companies and specializes in high-skilled contingent labor, focusing on end markets such as technology, financial & business services, and healthcare & life sciences. Magnit offers a “vendor-neutral” approach to CWM, sourcing talent from a broad range of third-party staffing agencies and direct channels to provide the highest quality solutions for customers.In October 2021 and May 2022 respectively, Magnit acquired Workforce Logiq and GRI, two vendor-neutral MSP \/ VMS providers. The additions of Workforce Logiq and GRI have helped accelerate value creation at Magnit by building scale and delivering a strong European footprint in attractive end markets and high-skilled roles.Market Trends and DriversThe global contingent workforce market is growing quickly, driven by the rise of the gig economy, a growing preference for freelance work, shortage of high-skill labor, increasing HCM compliance requirements, and increasing pressure on enterprises to drive cost reduction and efficiency. High-skill end markets like technology and healthcare, where Magnit focuses, are the highest growth areas of the contingent workforce market. Magnit is ideally positioned to benefit from increased contingent labor spend across its end markets.Investment Potential EQT will support Magnit in its next phase of development, as the business aims to expand into new end markets and geographies while growing its technology offering with existing customers, to become the premier global integrated platform for CWM. EQT will leverage its expertise in Europe and digital transformations to help accelerate Magnit’s development into a truly global technology solution for its customers.",

It launched exclusively into pet insurance in 2017 and now reaches millions of pet owners across Europe and the US. Today, ManyPets has emerged as one of the leading pet insurers in Europe and covers almost half a billion pets globally, including in the US, where it launched in early 2021.Market trends and driversThe pet insurance industry has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years, driven by strong secular tailwinds such as growing pet ownership and pets increasingly being considered as core family members by their owners. Nonetheless, pet insurance penetration is low in markets such as the UK and US and as a result, while scientific advances are enabling more sophisticated veterinary treatments, many pets are unable to access improved care. Thanks to its digital-first approach and customer centric focus, ManyPets is in prime position to continue expanding its market share.Investment potentialEQT Growth will be able to leverage its global advisory network and extensive local presence in both the US and all major European countries to support ManyPets’s international expansion and accelerate its growth. ManyPetswill also benefit from EQT’s long background in the pet industry, having developed IVC Evidensia (the largest veterinary clinic network in Europe) and Musti Group (the largest pet care specialist in the Nordics, listed on Nasdaq Helsinki since 2020).Find out more about the investment on EQT Growth’s Medium.",

Headquartered in Amsterdam, Mollie facilitates online payments acceptance for companies of all sizes across Europe. Mollie’s strong growth has been driven by its tech-forward product which is extremely user-friendly and has strong local payment method capabilities, a developer-friendly architecture, and out-of-the-box integrations with key small and medium enterprise (SME) business operations platforms.Market trends and DriversMollie’s addressable market has experienced strong growth in recent years as a result of consumers shifting their consumption patterns online, driving a rapid increase in e-commerce and electronic payments adoption. This growth has been especially pronounced in the historically underserved European SME online payments market, which in many countries remains dominated by legacy incumbents with ill-equipped technology offerings and therefore offers very attractive expansion opportunities for Mollie.Investment PotentialEQT Growth will leverage its deep networks in local European markets to help drive Mollie’s accelerated international expansion, including leveraging strong in-house digital marketing and technology teams to help fuel further growth. It will also employ its unique experience in scaling innovative, international fintechs - including Banking Circle, Bought By Many, Vault and VBill - as Mollie continues its journey to becoming Europe’s leading SME payments platform.Find out more about the investment on EQT Growth’s Medium.",

        "description":"Nordic Ferry Infrastructure, headquartered in Oslo, Norway was formed in February 2022 through the combination of the two local ferry and express boat operators, Molslinjen and Torghatten, as well as the addition of ForSea in January 2023. It is the leading pan-Nordic floating bridge operator with a well-diversified portfolio of 70 routes operated by over 100 vessels, transporting over 26 million passengers per year. Its subsidiaries are market leaders in their respective countries. Torghatten, founded in 1878, operates over 90 car ferries and smaller passenger ferries on 60 different connections along the Norwegian coastline, typically under medium to long term contracts with public transportation authorities. Danish Molslinjen, founded in 1963, links Denmark’s major population centers and connects several islands with the mainland. It operates a young, fit-for-purpose fleet of 21 vessels connecting 10 routes, including connections to Sweden and Germany, under long-term concession agreements as well as on a commercial basis as the sole operator with high barriers to entry.Market trends and driversNordic Ferry Infrastructure’s long-term development is supported by strong secular trends, such as a steady population and GDP growth, increased urbanization, increasing domestic travel and a stronger focus on decarbonizing societies, requiring operators to invest in zero or low emission transportation solutions. The Company is well positioned to capitalize on these shifts with its state-of-the-art ferry fleet, serving the most important travel corridors in the respective countries.Investment potentialWith a long track record of delivering profitable growth and operating a fit-for-purpose fleet on critical routes in the countries’ domestic transportation network, Nordic Ferry Infrastructure is well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in the underlying market. EQT intends to support the Company in its continued value creation journey through both organic and inorganic growth initiatives, domestically and cross-border, as well as digitalization and operational excellence initiatives.Furthermore, EQT is committed to supporting the Company’s ambitious sustainability agenda to invest in the decarbonization of its fleet to further reduce environmental footprint and to remain on the forefront of the green transition in maritime transport sector. These investments will future-proof the company and secure its “license to operate”, making it a more attractive partner for society, employees and passengers across the Nordic countries, as well as a more valuable company for future owners.Websites: molslinjen.com , torghatten.no",

Particular focus will be on strengthening the Company’s go-to-market approach, continue its internationalization especially into the US and broaden its product offering. In addition, it is intended to actively pursue synergistic M&A in a fragmented market.",

With this continued trend in aging infrastructure comes a heightened focus on reliability, safety, network resilience and management of the cost to maintain the infrastructure, driving the need for regular inspection, maintenance and restoration work, which Osmose provides.Despite the empirically proven benefits of regular maintenance programs, the addressable market penetration rate today is low and implies significant growth potential. Key market growth drivers include an increasing number of aging assets, outsourcing of services by utilities and increasing adoption of higher intensity maintenance programs due to regulatory tailwinds.Investment PotentialOsmose has a proven business model with a sound value proposition to its customers. The aim of the partnership is to continue refining the Company’s go-to-market strategy to accelerate service expansion with existing and new customers. Value creation levers include investing in the sales and marketing function, further refining data analytics capabilities, improving operational efficiency and acquiring other specialty utility services companies.",

The company also carries out engineering and infrastructure services.Saur is the #3 player in its core French water market with a historically stable ~17% market share and clear leadership in its local and regional strongholds; it has ~8,000 employees in France and ~12,000 globally.In France, the company primarily operates under long-term contracts of 10-12 years with municipalities. Under those mostly asset-light delegation contracts, Saur manages the full operations at own risk in exchange for revenues from the end-consumers. The assets typically remain in the ownership of the local authority.Market trends and driversFrance is one of the few countries, where water supply and treatment is dominated by private operators under long-term contracts.The private water management market serving municipalities in France amounts to approximately EUR 4.9bn and is expected to experience stable and moderate growth going forward. The market is characterized by strong resilience and high barriers to entry. As such, the three main players have had stable market shares over the past decades without any new competition arising.Outside of France, Saur is particularly active in the stable and attractive Spanish, Portuguese and Saudi Arabian water markets.Investment potentialSaur has a proven business model with a sound value proposition for local municipalities and industrial customers.Saur‘s value creation strategy is centered around strengthening the company’s position as a leading water company in France. This will be achieved by fostering commercial excellence, constantly improving operational performance, increasing efficiency and investing into technology and digitalization.In addition, Saur can expand its service offering into faster growing related markets, such as industrial water and pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities outside of France.",

Customers include carriers, enterprises, governments, healthcare organizations, defense, education and small businesses.Market trends and driversThe demand for fiber connectivity is growing, driven by secular trends associated with fundamental shifts in both consumer and enterprise behaviors. There has been explosive growth in the proliferation of bandwidth intensive applications (e.g., cloud computing, remote data storage, over the top video streaming, social networking, etc.). Enterprises continue to migrate away from legacy networks towards reliable, high bandwidth fiber-centric networks in order to connect to discrete locations, data centers, and key locations within their organizations. Wireless carriers depend on fiber infrastructure providers to connect to macro cellular towers and deploy small cell sites to meet the growing mobile data usage of their customers. Fiber infrastructure providers such as Segra are poised to benefit from these secular trends.Investment potentialThe investment potential for Segra is to continue investing in and growing the Company’s fiber business both organically and inorganically to capitalize on attractive market trends. Value creation levers include ramping up the sales team to accelerate growth using superior flexibility and service, enhancing the product portfolio to drive additional spend from customers, and expanding the network through an attractive pipeline of acquisition opportunities.",

ADT Caps was established in 1971 (originally Korea Security Corporation) and SK Infosec was established in 2000. SK Shieldus was established in 2021 following the merger of ADT Caps (physical security) and SK Infosec (cybersecurity).SK Shieldus is the second largest centralized monitoring and dispatch service provider in South Korea with an installed network of connected digital security infrastructure such as sensors and cameras at customers’ premises and is the largest Managed Security Service provider in the country’s cybersecurity space, supported by a long track record of operations and a vast proprietary database of threat intelligence.Market trends and driversSK Shieldus is supported by strong tailwinds, such as increased digitization, South Korea’s aging population, and rising sophistication of the country’s economy, which favor outsourced central monitoring security adoption. Particularly, the fast-growing cybersecurity market with ongoing cloud transition and increased cyberthreat.SK Shieldus is focused on providing a critical public safety service to the Korean society. The country’s aging population has led to labor pressures, which in turn means that “manned guards” are less economically viable. The company provides a digitally-supported alternative, effectively acting as an outsourced private police force. SK Shieldus acts as the first responder to cybersecurity breaches and is becoming increasingly mission-critical for Korean businesses.Investment potentialSK Shieldus is expected to leverage EQT’s strong sector expertise within physical and cybersecurity drawing on its experience from developing companies in adjacent verticals, such as Securitas Direct, Utimaco, and CYE. Moreover, EQT’s in-house digitalization capabilities will be a key value-creation lever for SK Shieldus as EQT Infrastructure aims to sophisticate the company’s digital security service offering, allowing more tailored services for each customer segment with the ambition to make South Korea safer in both physical and digital domains.",

The Company was founded in 1997 and spun out from TTP Group and has local presence across Europe, North America and Asia.SPT Labtech’s instruments automate process steps for genomic and structural biology applications and in the drug discovery process which are otherwise done manually hence eliminating costly process errors \/ sample losses in research and freeing up capacity of highly educated and expensive researchers for more value-add analyses.Market trends and drivers Supported by strong secular megatrends, SPT presents a highly thematic investment opportunity within EQT’s prioritized Life Science Tools subsector. The automation of research, miniaturization trends (more analyses with the same sample volume) and a broader adoption of multi-omics will support SPT’s core liquid handling business for years to come.SPT is the leader in resilient and fast-growing market niches, including in its core segment, the low-throughput liquid handling market and is strongly positioned in in the Cryo-EM segment, a cutting-edge technique supporting the research of new drug targets within novel modalities like cell and gene therapy, as well as mRNA. SPT helps researchers save time through automation and enables labs to research for example chronic illnesses and provide treatments or find cures for previously untreatable conditions.Investment potentialUnder EQT Private Equity’s ownership, the Company will benefit from EQT’s strong advisor and expert network as well as the inhouse digital team. EQT will further support the Company in new product innovation, expansion into existing and new geographies and end-markets (e.g., catering to the in-vitro diagnostics market, doubling down on APAC and accelerating Cryo-EM) as well as selective M&A to further strengthen SPT’s market position.",

        "description":"About SUSESUSE’s offering is grouped into two open source software product categories – the SUSE Linux Enterprise product family, which comprises its core Linux operating system offering, and the SUSE Rancher product family, which includes its container management and storage offering. Taken together, these are the key pillars of every modern enterprise’s digital transformation strategy. SUSE also has a differentiated Edge offering, consisting of a comprehensive platform of purpose-built Linux and Kubernetes technologies that enable its customers to build, deploy, run, and manage Edge workloads.SUSE’s more than 1,900 employees develop and deliver innovative solutions to its blue-chip customer base from a broad network of hubs in Europe, the United States, South America and Asia. SUSE leverages its globally scaled, multi-channel go-to-market platform to sell its solutions both directly as well as through indirect channels such as Value-Added Resellers, Cloud and Managed Service Providers, and Independent Hardware Vendors.SUSE has an exceptional financial profile characterized by fast growing, recurring revenue at scale, combined with very high profitability and cash generation. In FY2020, SUSE recorded 17 percent growth in revenue year-on-year, with 98 percent of revenue derived from recurring subscription revenue.Market trends & driversSUSE operates within several attractive markets that benefit from global megatrends like big data, rising cloud adoption and the growing popularity of IoT \/ Edge, which are leading to many enterprises accelerating their digital transformation and fundamentally changing their IT infrastructure. Growing adoption of open source technologies and the digitalization of workloads are driving exponential growth in workloads and data, which is also driving the move of existing and new workloads to hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. At the same time, the massive growth of the IoT market, which requires Edge computing, is also driving demand for Linux and containers.SUSE is well-positioned within these vast and rapidly growing markets. Its total addressable market comprised of Linux enterprise operating systems, container management and storage, and Edge is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17 percent between 2020 and 2024, reaching approximately USD 34 billion by 2024. Moreover, the serviceable addressable market is expected to grow even faster than the total addressable market, with an annual growth rate of 24 percent between 2020 and 2024.Investment potentialSince the acquisition in 2018, EQT and SUSE have laid the foundations for rapid growth acceleration, starting with the reinforcement of the Company management team. It also invested heavily in its marketing function and fundamentally upgraded its go-to-market strategy, creating a globally scaled, multi-channel platform.SUSE’s acquisition of Rancher in December 2020 has further accelerated growth, propelling SUSE into a leadership position in the highly dynamic container management platform space. This is a prime example of SUSE’s unique opportunity to leverage its globally scaled platform for acquisitions, supported by EQT.",

It also provides advisory and marketing services to leading global brands. UTA has undergone a dramatic strategic expansion over the past few years, through investments and strategic acquisitions, to solidify its position as one of the “big 3” talent agencies in the US.UTA is headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Nashville, New York and London. The company has nearly 1,900 employees globally.Market Trends and DriversMedia and entertainment continue to benefit from long-term tailwinds such as increased content spend and new mediums for distribution, fueled by the streaming wars and the globalization of content and fandom. Nascent forms of entertainment such as podcasts, digital media and Web3 have also created more avenues for content creation and opportunities for talent. The talent agencies have an attractive position within this market, acting as the “gateway marketplace” connecting talent with monetizers, benefitting from the overall growth of content regardless of its distribution, vertical, or end market.Investment PotentialEQT will support UTA in its next phase of growth as the company looks to invest both in its core business and into select adjacencies. EQT will leverage its global presence to help the company with international expansion, develop more robust digital capabilities through collaboration with EQT Motherbrain, fuel expansion within sports, and invest to continue providing best-in-class service to clients.",

        "description":"About vBillFounded in 2011 and headquartered in Beijing, VBill offers a full range of payment solutions, including bank card acquiring, QR code and other omni-channel payment, Internet payment and others. By leveraging its extensive merchant base, VBill also provides value-added services, such as fintech-enabled consumer lending as well as credit card and loan application facilitation. Under the leadership of the founding management team, possessing more than 20 years of industry experience, VBill has achieved remarkable growth since inception, and is today a leading merchant acquirer with a comprehensive service offering, extensive merchant base and innovative and extensive sales coverage network.With a strong management team and the support and relevant payment services experience from the EQT Network, VBill is well-positioned to capture the attractive growth opportunities in the large and fast-growing third-party payment market in China. The strategy includes continued expansion into lower-tier cities and penetration in SMEs, developing value-added services, and opportunistically identifying overseas expansion opportunities in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.Market trends and DriversThe offline third-party payment market in China is large and fast-growing with a total market size of ~RMB 42tn in transaction volume in 2018 and is expected to grow at ~20% annually to reach ~RMB 127tn by 2024.Apart from traditional bank cards, China has undergone significant development and proliferation in payment innovation such as QR code payments, Internet payment and NFC to evolve towards a cashless society. With such diversity and complexity in payment processing, an integrated payment solution provider such as VBill plays an important role to warrant seamless transactions between consumers, merchants, banks, card and e-wallet issuers, and settlement networks.Furthermore, the industry is growing beyond transaction processing with increasing sophistication. Vertically, there is strong potential and demand for industry-specific payment solutions and cross-border payment capabilities, while horizontally, payment solution providers are expanding into value-add services such as microlending and credit card application facilitation to enhance user stickiness and monetization.Investment PotentialThe diversification of payment methods in the fragmented Chinese market makes merchant acquiring a complicated business. By leveraging VBill’s technological advantages, large merchant base and EQT’s expertise, VBill is well-positioned to transform into a leading integrated payment solution provider, gain further market share and capitalize on the secular trend of going cashless in China.To fully realize the value of its large and sticky user base, VBill intends to continue developing its core merchant acquiring business while actively expanding into other adjacent businesses with the goal of becoming a comprehensive fin-tech solutions provider.EQT is excited to support the continued growth of VBill by combining the Company’s technological and execution capabilities with EQT’s network and resources across the globe to tap into the massive overseas markets as a fin-tech platform provider. EQT will also support VBill in its goal to be the cross-border payment partner of choice through equity investments or strategic alliances.",

The Company installs, owns, and maintains laundry machines in common-area laundry rooms. Once installed, WASH also collects digital and currency payments from the machines on behalf of property owners. The Company utilizes sophisticated routing technology to manage a fleet of approximately 640k machines serviced by ~880 technology-enabled vehicles and 370+ highly skilled service technicians providing high-quality services to their customers, who have an average tenure of more than 20 years and a 98% retention rate. The Company is headquartered in Torrance, California, USA.Market trends and driversThe outsourced laundry services industry is a fragmented market with two national competitors including WASH. WASH is the #1 market leader in 90% of the markets in which it operates, including Canada and California, and is recognized for providing a high-quality service to its customers. WASH serves multifamily and university customers who currently outsource management of their laundry rooms, with additional opportunity to convert owner-operated locations. The industry is characterized by recession resilience given its essential service nature, consistent price increases supported by inelastic consumer behavior, and a stable outlook for the broader multifamily housing market.Investment potentialThe Company has a history of consistent organic growth and has successfully integrated over a dozen acquisitions under EQT ownership. The value creation plan focuses on organic growth through further penetration of customers within existing and new markets, continued vend increase optimization, furthering the shift to coinless payments, and executing additional accretive acquisitions given the fragmented nature of the industry.",

Its product spectrum covers the full range of hearing aids and accessories across all price categories. Development has always been a top priority as evidenced by many “world’s firsts” in hearing aid history, including the first hearing aid with a rechargeable battery. In addition, WS Audiology has become the leading online retailer of hearing aids through the acquisition of audibene in March 2015 and subsequent global expansion and acceleration of their business model.The successful merger between two leading hearing aid companies has created a strong player with combined revenues of more than EUR 1.7 billion, over 10,000 employees and one of the strongest R&D teams in the industry. WS Audiology is driven by a passion to improve the quality of life for more than 700 million people with hearing needs globally. Together, the two pioneers have a combined experience of more than 170 years and will redefine the competitive landscape in the more than 125 countries they are present in.Market trends and driversWS Audiology operates in a highly attractive market with healthy, non-cyclical growth driven by a growing addressable population due to: 1) An overall aging population, 2) Daily noise pollution increasing the number of hearing impaired people, 3) An increasing penetration of hearing aids users among the hearing impaired people thanks to improved technology and social acceptance and 4) increasing demand for hearing aids in developing countriesInvestment potentialEQT VI, EQT VII and EQT VIII’s value creation plan is focused on continued investments into R&D to ensure future technology platforms continue to be best-in-class, solidifying the position as digital leader, driving commercial excellence and realizing synergies from the merger to secure a competitive cost position.",

The Company’s customers include large and sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure, such as wireless service providers, telecommunications companies, financial services businesses, social networking, media, and web content companies, education, research and healthcare institutions, and governmental agencies.Market trends and driversThe demand for fiber connectivity is growing, driven by secular trends associated with fundamental shifts in both consumer and enterprise behaviors. There has been explosive growth in the proliferation of bandwidth intensive applications (e.g., cloud computing, remote data storage, over the top video streaming, social networking, etc.). Enterprises continue to migrate away from legacy networks towards reliable, high bandwidth fiber-centric networks in order to connect to discrete locations, data centers, and key locations within their organizations. Wireless carriers depend on fiber infrastructure providers to increase carriers’ coverage and densification requirements, resulting in significantly increased demand for bandwidth infrastructure, specifically for fiber backhaul for existing 4G sites and upgrades for such sites to 5G. End users such as private enterprises (e.g., media\/ content providers, financial institutions and hospital systems) and public sector entities (e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) are increasingly focused on digital transformations which have increased the amount of data they are trading in, thus increasing their need for reliable fiber network infrastructure. Fiber infrastructure providers such as Zayo are poised to benefit from these secular trends.",

        "description":"About AnticimexAnticimex's business model is built on service contracts, and different types of insurance contracts, bringing predictable and recurring revenues.The mission is to provide preventive pest control solutions to both companies and consumers. This translates into providing consumers and businesses with \"peace of mind' and a pest free indoor environment and safeguarding industries' food production.Anticimex was founded in Sweden in 1934 as a family business and the company name is Latin for \"against bedbugs\". In 1973, the company ventured into Norway and in the 1990s, hygiene solutions for food shops, restaurants and industries were developed. In the 2000s, Anticimex expanded into Denmark, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands.During EQT's ownership Anticimex have completed more than 200 add-on acquisitions and expanded the geographical presence from being in five countries in northern Europe to being in 18 countries across Europe, Asia-Pacific and the US. In addition, Anticimex has established its position as the frontrunner in digital pest control and has more than 150,000 SMART devices installed globally. In 2019, the combined sales amounted to approximately SEK 8.0bn (EUR 800m).Market trends and driversThe global pest control market is growing at a rate above GDP driven by increased frequency of pest – which in turn is fuelled by increased travelling, urbanization, and warmer climate – as well as new and stricter regulation for hygiene standards. The market is characterized by its mission critical nature.Investment potentialWhen acquired by EQT, Anticimex had been growing steadily for 77 consecutive years. The business is solutions oriented with a scalable business model, and the market provides good opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions. The European pest control market is highly fragmented with the top two players representing less than one fifth of the market. The sector is supported by solid fundamentals where contracts are subscription-based and the services\/solutions are often mission critical for the customer. In addition to the above, the value creation plan also includes a further expansion of the service offering and cross-selling initiatives as well as a continued extension of partnerships.",

This was further facilitated by the hiring of top industry talent, including CEO Todd DeLaughter, into Automic’s management team.In January 2017, EQT sold Automic to CA Technologies in a transaction valuing Automic at EUR 600 million.",

The value creation plan centered around strengthening the organization with a strong second level management team, expanding the store network and fostering same store sales growth through a continuous shift from simple bakery products into snacks, hot and cold drinks, sandwiches and other convenience food offerings.During EQT’s ownership, BackWerk’s management, the supervisory board and EQT worked together to accelerate the strategic repositioning from a bakery chain to a leading German quick-service convenience food concept with a high and growing share of out-of-home sales. It was supported by a new brand strategy, a revitalization of the store concept as well as a strengthened product offering focusing on out-of-home products. BackWerk grew its store footprint from some 300 to over 340 locations and successfully expanded into the Netherlands. Under EQT’s ownership, BackWerk was transformed from being a founder-led company to having a strong corporate governance model with an independent management team leading the business.In October 2017, EQT sold BackWerk to Valora Group in a transaction valuing BackWerk at approximately EUR 190 million.",

The product portfolio includes mission-critical validation systems used for measuring and documenting critical parameters, solutions for continuous monitoring of critical processes and environments as well as field service and consulting. The offerings are highly integrated with industry leading, user-friendly software applications.The company employs approximately 750 people worldwide with sales in more than 70 countries, serving a blue-chip customer base covering all the top 40 pharmaceutical companies globally.Market trends and driversThe global addressable market for validation- and monitoring solutions and services is a fast-growing market across geographies, driven by underlying global macro trends such as increasing regulation, rising focus on consumer safety, Industry 4.0, services outsourcing penetration and growing demand from pharmaceutical end-markets. The market is non-cyclical given the mission-criticality of validation and monitoring solutions and the associated regulatory requirements, and further has high formal and informal entry barriers, such as relationship-driven sales models and high switching costs.Investment potentialWhen acquired by EQT, Ellab had been growing profitably at a double-digit organic growth rate for 15 years. This had been enabled by an entrenched leadership position in the growing niche market for thermal validation and monitoring, supported by strong underlying and non-cyclical macro trends. During the ownership, EQT will support the continued global growth of Ellab through an array of organic and inorganic growth levers. On the organic side, EQT will focus on supporting Ellab to strengthen leadership in the profitable core markets by investing in R&D (with focus on software), digitalization and sales force, continue investments in services offering allowing Ellab to further monetize its existing customer base while expanding market opportunity, growing presence in high-end monitoring market by launching new best-in-class solution and scaling it, further invest in software solutions and further scale sustainability efforts. On the inorganic side, EQT will focus on acquiring and consolidating primarily field service and consulting targets in US and Europe.",

Over the past 10 years, Facile, meaning ”easy” in Italian, has established itself as a brand name through effective and smart online and TV marketing. Facile has achieved an average annual top-line growth of 21% over the past five years and in 2017 the company generated approximately EUR 71 million in sales pro-forma.Originally focused on motor insurance, Facile has sucessfully diversified accross all main household, insurance and personal finance products over the past 4 years. Today motor insurance generates around 2\/3 of the revenue while other products generate the rest and continue to grow strongly.Beside its slick online website and effective call-centers, Facile also offers customers access to a network of insurance\/mortgage agents and, since last year, a network of stores. This makes the company multi-channel, a rare feature in the OPC (online price comparison) space and very well tailored to the Italian market where consumers expect more offline interaction vs other European markets.",

        "description":"Scandic has over 40,000 hotels rooms and mainly operates full-service, leased hotels where the rent is related to Scandic’s revenues from the individual hotel. The restaurants account for almost one third of Scandic’s total revenues, and guests are a mix from the business, conference and leisure markets.Scandic opened its first hotel in 1963 in Sweden and expanded into Norway and Denmark in 1973. In 1990, the first hotels outside Scandinavia were opened and in 1996, Scandic was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Scandic was acquired by EQT in 2007 from the Hilton Group whom had owned the company since 2001. In 2014 Scandic acquired Rica Hotels in Norway and further strengthened its position as the leading hotel chain in the Nordic region. In Norway alone, Scandic’s coverage was increased by 65 hotels, thus becoming a nationwide chain.To ScandicMarket trends and driversThe key driver for the hotel business is the overall economic growth and business climate. This ultimately impacts both business and leisure travel as well the conference industry.Changing exchange rates influence leisure travel in particular and can cause fluctuations in the demand for hotel rooms. In difficult economic times there is a consistent trend that business travellers switch from more expensive hotels in the top luxury segment to less pricey accommodation in the three to four star mid-market segment.Price and quality transparency is steadily increasing by way of price comparison, booking and travel sites on the internet. Today, an overwhelming majority of bookings are made online by corporations and individuals.Investment potentialWhen EQT acquired Scandic it was the market leader in the Nordic mid-market hotel segment. Scandic had a stable client base with a high degree of returning customers.There was a potential for further operational efficiency and accelerated organic growth coupled with selected acquisitions. The measures identified included ramping up the Nordic expansion and opening new hotels in Norway and Finland where Scandic was underrepresented and at the same time taking Scandic's strong brand and operational concept to new markets like Germany and Poland.The development plan also calls for increasing efficiency by clustering reservations, boosting the yield management system and implementing extensive best-practice across the hotel portfolio.A sale of selected, non-core real estate is also part of the development plan.",
