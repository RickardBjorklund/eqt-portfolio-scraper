Anticimex today operates close to 200 branches across Europe, Asia, Pacific, North America and Latin America with a focus on pest control services, but also offers certain additional complementary services in selected markets, including hygiene and building environment services. Anticimex also offers pest control and building environment services through insurance arrangements in Europe.Anticimex' business model is built on service and insurance contracts, creating stable and recurring revenues. The mission is to provide customers with \u201cpeace of mind\u201d and a pest free indoor environment with preventative pest control solutions.Impact AnglePest infestations are detrimental to society by contaminating food, spreading disease and causing economic losses. Thus, pest control is vital to keeping societies healthy and reducing societal, environmental and economic costs caused by infestations.Anticimex is leading the transformation of the industry towards digital and preventative pest control. Its sensor-based solution Anticimex SMART detects when a pest infestation is about to happen and can also predict where it might happen next, thus maximizing prevention and minimizing the negative impact of pests. It is also toxin-free and hence has no impact on natural ecosystems and lowers GHG emissions as unnecessary trips are eliminated.EQT Future\u2019s theory of change is therefore one where Anticimex transforms traditional pest control to a sustainable industry which does not use toxic substances, protects ecosystems, prevents waste and minimises emissions - aligned with the fund\u2019s Planet objective.Market Trends and DriversThe pest control market is supported by a number of structural growth drivers, including increasing pest prevalence due to urbanization, globalization and climate change as well as decreasing societal tolerance of pests due to cultural change, increased purchasing power and increasing health and safety regulation. The market is also fragmented with large consolidation potential. Anticimex is well-positioned to capitalise on these drivers through its global platform, best in class service offering and decentralised operating model.Investment PotentialEQT Future will support Anticimex in its next growth phase with a focus on continuing EQT VI\u2019s proven value creation model while accelerating positive impact by leading the sustainable transformation of the industry.Value creation will remain focused on sustaining strong organic growth, continued M&A execution and international expansion.

Increasing wallpaper penetration ratio, more frequent renovation cycle and higher ASP through introduction of innovative new products will drive continuous future growth.Continued rising disposable income accelerates consumption upgrade in China. With improving living conditions and rising demand for more artistic and eco-friendly decoration solutions, wallpaper is becoming more and more popular among Chinese households. Moreover, aging home and houses built during the 1990s (first decade of Chinese Real Estate commercialization period) are entering a renovation period, which further drives the market growth. Lastly, the China wallpaper market is fragmented with top 10 players representing only one third of market share. The market leaders like Artwall will benefit most from the industry consolidation trend.Investment potentialGiven its strong product offering, creative in-house design capability and industry leading flexible digital print-on-demand technology, Artwall is well-positioned to capture the growth opportunities in the under-penetrated wallpaper market in China and benefit from the increasing trend of more frequent home and house renovations.EQT will support the company through further expansion of product offering to transform the company into a fully-integrated soft decoration solution provider. EQT will also support the company to consolidate the industry via value accretive acquisitions. In September 2018, Artwall announced the acquisition of Brewster\u2019s China business.

With improving living conditions and rising disposable income in China, property owners and managers are looking for more comprehensive and high-quality property management services.Moreover, outsourcing penetration in China is low compared to both developing and developed countries, providing room for further penetration. The increasing outsourcing rate in China is driven by facility management service providers offering better service quality, cost efficiency and integrated solutions.Lastly, the China facility management market is highly fragmented with top 8 players only representing 4% of market share. Ongoing consolidation is expected to present further growth opportunities.Investment potentialGiven its high customer advocacy, proven track record and management team being one of the most experienced in the sector, China Shine is well-positioned to capture the attractive and structural growth in the China facility management market.EQT is excited to support the continued growth of the company through further expansion into service offerings such as specialized cleaning, pest control, security and hardware maintenance which will add depth to the current portfolio, increase margins and improve client stickiness. The business plan also calls for expansion in geographical coverage and further penetration in the existing geographical footprint.China Shine intends to accelerate growth and consolidate the industry via value accretive acquisitions. The buy-and-build strategy will further supplement the Company\u2019s service offerings and support its ambition to become a leading national fully-integrated facility management service platform."

Covanta\u2019s 41 waste to energy (\u201cWtE\u201d) facilities process and convert ~22mm tons of waste into enough renewable energy to power one million homes annually, while its 16 material processing facilities (\u201cMPFs\u201d) process an additional 700k tons of profiled waste for recycling and assured destruction per year. The company\u2019s operations generate more than 10 million megawatt hours (\u201cMWh\u201d) of baseload electricity and recover 600,000 tons of metals.Covanta is the clear leader in a very stable industry that is underpinned by long-term contracts, high barriers to entry, and positive tailwinds related to sustainability advantages versus landfills. The company has an expansive national footprint serving more than 3,000 municipal and industrial customers with approximately 4,000 dedicated employees. Covanta is a mission-driven company, focused on being a leading sustainable waste solutions provider in an increasingly circular economy.Market Trends and DriversThe waste management market is very stable and steadily growing at a similar rate to GDP and population growth. Within waste management, sustainable solutions such as Covanta\u2019s are enjoying regulatory tailwinds due to restrictive emission standards on landfills and higher customer demand driven by municipal and corporate initiatives such as \u201czero-waste-to-landfill\u201d and circular economy goals. Landfill moratoriums in states such as Massachusetts and New York are increasing the competitive moat for waste to energy and recycling, underscoring the essential nature of Covanta\u2019s asset base. Demand from industrial clients to satisfy their emerging ESG goals has also been steadily climbing as companies prioritize more sustainable waste solutions for the environment.Investment PotentialThe Covanta investment is highly thematic to the EQT franchise, facilitating EQT\u2019s direct participation in the broader growing circular economy through sustainable waste solutions. The goal of this partnership is to continue to help the company grow and expand its positive impact on society. Key value creation opportunities include increasing profiled waste solutions, growing environmental solutions business, increasing recycling of metals, optimizing plant operations, and strengthening leading ESG focus.

Formerly known as Covanta Europe, its state-of-the-art energy recovery facilities support the transition to a circular economy by making productive use of residual waste that would otherwise go to landfill. With expertise stretching back over three decades, extensive partnerships and continuous innovation, Encyclis provides a progressive solution for waste management which accelerates the journey to net-zero.Market trends & driversUK and EU policy is based on a \u201cwaste hierarchy\u201d mechanism where energy recovery is preferred for waste that cannot be recycled \u2013 \u201cresidual waste\u201d.In the UK, the introduction of landfill tax has spurred UK EfW development over the past decade towards an equilibrium of waste supply and incineration capacity in the medium term. The capacity gap between EfW capacity and residual waste supply still exists although based on known construction projects this is set to reduce through the decade. One of the key value levers for Encyclis is to secure development projects as the UK market tightens.In Ireland, Encyclis\u2019 Dublin plant is the only facility in the Dublin vicinity and critical to the treatment of Irish waste. Without this plant, substantial volumes of non-recyclable Irish waste would need to be sent abroad or to landfill.Investment PotentialEncyclis is the result of the legal separation of Covanta\u2019s European operations from Covanta Holdings Corporation (EQT Infrastructure V portfolio company). This separation provides a unique opportunity to develop a standalone European EfW platform and unlock its core value by successfully delivering under construction facilities to operation and consolidating Encyclis as a leading operator in the UK and Ireland. EQT Infrastructure, through its purpose-driven investment approach, is supporting Encyclis to drive sustainable waste processing and enable transitions to a circular economy, playing a key role in empowering and supporting the UK and Ireland\u2019s ambitions towards net zero."

The company is a global market leader in air transport of temperature sensitive pharmaceuticals. With the world's largest fleet of specialized containers and close collaboration with airlines and freight forwarders, Envirotainer meets the pharmaceutical industry's complex need for fast and safe cold chain shipments where the pharmaceutical maintains exactly the right temperature throughout transport - from factory to end user.Biological drugs are very temperature sensitive and large values are lost every year due to shortcomings in the logistics chain. Envirotainer's solutions provide the opportunity to meet complex and regulatory requirements when transporting these medicines under controlled temperatures. Thus, the company has a key role to play in ensuring that vital treatments, such as vaccines, insulin and oncological drugs, reach patients safely. Envirotainer delivered two million doses of medication every day in 2021.Market trends and driversEnvirotainer is uniquely positioned as the market leader and industry gold standard, in a highly attractive, resilient and strongly growing niche market with exposure to the underlying biopharma market. The market growth is supported by secular trends such as growing and aging global population, stricter pharma regulatory requirements and innovation of pharma products requiring cold chain solutions.Millions of people across the globe depend on the safe delivery of biopharmaceuticals that require temperature control to maintain their integrity and quality. Today, lack of access to medicines is a cause for distress that disproportionately impacts underserved communities, whose situation is likely to be exacerbated by chronic diseases resulting from changing diets and lifestyles, as well as from air and water pollution. Envirotainer expands access to vital pharmaceuticals and vaccines through its patient-safe, reliable and efficient cold chain solutions, which also offer one of the lowest carbon footprint solutions in the industry.Investment potentialEQT Private Equity will support Envirotainer in its next phase of growth by accelerating expansion in APAC and further driving growth in its other core markets, while investing behind new technology innovations, digitalization and sustainability in its operations."

Deployment will take place exclusively in Flanders and focus on the suburban areas of the region. The JV Partners are committed to supporting the company in creating a best-in-class roll-out machine to ensure that fiber connectivity can be offered to households from as early as 2021.Market Trends and DriversBelgium is one of the most attractive growth markets for fiber in Europe as the penetration rates are significantly lower than in other European countries. Specifically, in 2019 only 7% of Belgian households had access to an FTTH internet connection compared to 77% in Sweden and 45% in the Netherlands. At the same time demand for bandwidth is expected to continue increasing strongly driven primarily by rising data volumes and the growth of use cases such as video streaming and remote working.Enabling future-proof and reliable broadband access thus becomes more and more important and the JV will make an important contribution to facilitating digital inclusion and sustainable economic growth.Investment PotentialFiberklaar is committed to roll out a large-scale, open access FTTH network that will provide fiber connectivity to at least 1.5 million households and small businesses in the Flemish Region of Belgium. The company will be able to leverage the unique combination of EQT Infrastructure\u2019s vast experience from developing strong fiber companies in Europe and North America and Proximus\u2019 unrivalled expertise in the Belgian telecom market. Fiberklaar will drive network utilization on the back of superior infrastructure offering and favourable speed-independent pricing available to all service providers."

First Transit operates a comprehensive portfolio of complementary public transportation services on behalf of cities, municipalities, and businesses, including fixed route buses and trains, paratransit services, shuttle buses, outsourced vehicle maintenance and other services.Market trends and driversStudent and public transportation are critical components of the US and Canadian educational and economic ecosystems, with student success metrics and funding directly correlated to student attendance, and millions of individuals across the socioeconomic spectrum relying on public transportation daily to get to work, access healthcare, and contribute to the broader economy. As a result of the essential nature of services provided, the public transportation end market is highly stable through economic cycle and benefits from favourable tailwinds including increasing demand for outsourcing and for safer, smarter and more environmentally friendly transportation options. The growing capital intensity and operational complexity associated with digitizing operations and electrifying the fleet will place greater demand across the value chain and favor large, resource-rich outsourced providers, such as First Student and First Transit, who bring best-in-class safety, reliability, capital, and technological expertise to districts and governments.Investment potentialEQT Infrastructure is committed to building upon the success First Student and First Transit have achieved by making investments in organizational, operational, digital, and sustainability initiatives to further improve and differentiate the Company\u2019s service offering.

Nonetheless, pet insurance penetration is low in markets such as the UK and US and as a result, while scientific advances are enabling more sophisticated veterinary treatments, many pets are unable to access improved care. Thanks to its digital-first approach and customer centric focus, ManyPets is in prime position to continue expanding its market share.Investment potentialEQT Growth will be able to leverage its global advisory network and extensive local presence in both the US and all major European countries to support ManyPets\u2019s international expansion and accelerate its growth. ManyPetswill also benefit from EQT\u2019s long background in the pet industry, having developed IVC Evidensia (the largest veterinary clinic network in Europe) and Musti Group (the largest pet care specialist in the Nordics, listed on Nasdaq Helsinki since 2020).Find out more about the investment on EQT Growth\u2019s Medium."

Key market growth drivers include an increasing number of aging assets, outsourcing of services by utilities and increasing adoption of higher intensity maintenance programs due to regulatory tailwinds.Investment PotentialOsmose has a proven business model with a sound value proposition to its customers. The aim of the partnership is to continue refining the Company\u2019s go-to-market strategy to accelerate service expansion with existing and new customers.

Under those mostly asset-light delegation contracts, Saur manages the full operations at own risk in exchange for revenues from the end-consumers. The assets typically remain in the ownership of the local authority.Market trends and driversFrance is one of the few countries, where water supply and treatment is dominated by private operators under long-term contracts.The private water management market serving municipalities in France amounts to approximately EUR 4.9bn and is expected to experience stable and moderate growth going forward. The market is characterized by strong resilience and high barriers to entry. As such, the three main players have had stable market shares over the past decades without any new competition arising.Outside of France, Saur is particularly active in the stable and attractive Spanish, Portuguese and Saudi Arabian water markets.Investment potentialSaur has a proven business model with a sound value proposition for local municipalities and industrial customers.Saur\u2018s value creation strategy is centered around strengthening the company\u2019s position as a leading water company in France. This will be achieved by fostering commercial excellence, constantly improving operational performance, increasing efficiency and investing into technology and digitalization.In addition, Saur can expand its service offering into faster growing related markets, such as industrial water and pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities outside of France."

Customers include carriers, enterprises, governments, healthcare organizations, defense, education and small businesses.Market trends and driversThe demand for fiber connectivity is growing, driven by secular trends associated with fundamental shifts in both consumer and enterprise behaviors. There has been explosive growth in the proliferation of bandwidth intensive applications (e.g., cloud computing, remote data storage, over the top video streaming, social networking, etc.). Enterprises continue to migrate away from legacy networks towards reliable, high bandwidth fiber-centric networks in order to connect to discrete locations, data centers, and key locations within their organizations. Wireless carriers depend on fiber infrastructure providers to connect to macro cellular towers and deploy small cell sites to meet the growing mobile data usage of their customers. Fiber infrastructure providers such as Segra are poised to benefit from these secular trends.Investment potentialThe investment potential for Segra is to continue investing in and growing the Company\u2019s fiber business both organically and inorganically to capitalize on attractive market trends. Value\u00a0creation levers include ramping up the sales team to accelerate growth using superior flexibility and service, enhancing the product portfolio to drive additional spend from customers, and expanding the network through an attractive pipeline of acquisition opportunities."

Under the leadership of the founding management team, possessing more than 20 years of industry experience, VBill has achieved remarkable growth since inception, and is today a leading merchant acquirer with a comprehensive service offering, extensive merchant base and innovative and extensive sales coverage network.With a strong management team and the support and relevant payment services experience from the EQT Network, VBill is well-positioned to capture the attractive growth opportunities in the large and fast-growing third-party payment market in China. The strategy includes continued expansion into lower-tier cities and penetration in SMEs, developing value-added services, and opportunistically identifying overseas expansion opportunities in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.Market trends and DriversThe offline third-party payment market in China is large and fast-growing with a total market size of ~RMB 42tn in transaction volume in 2018 and is expected to grow at ~20% annually to reach ~RMB 127tn by 2024.Apart from traditional bank cards, China has undergone significant development and proliferation in payment innovation such as QR code payments, Internet payment and NFC to evolve towards a cashless society. With such diversity and complexity in payment processing, an integrated payment solution provider such as VBill plays an important role to warrant seamless transactions between consumers, merchants, banks, card and e-wallet issuers, and settlement networks.Furthermore, the industry is growing beyond transaction processing with increasing sophistication. Vertically, there is strong potential and demand for industry-specific payment solutions and cross-border payment capabilities, while horizontally, payment solution providers are expanding into value-add services such as microlending and credit card application facilitation to enhance user stickiness and monetization.Investment PotentialThe diversification of payment methods in the fragmented Chinese market makes merchant acquiring a complicated business. By leveraging VBill\u2019s technological advantages, large merchant base and EQT\u2019s expertise, VBill is well-positioned to transform into a leading integrated payment solution provider, gain further market share and capitalize on the secular trend of going cashless in China.To fully realize the value of its large and sticky user base, VBill intends to continue developing its core merchant acquiring business while actively expanding into other adjacent businesses with the goal of becoming a comprehensive fin-tech solutions provider.EQT is excited to support the continued growth of VBill by combining the Company\u2019s technological and execution capabilities with EQT\u2019s network and resources across the globe to tap into the massive overseas markets as a fin-tech platform provider.

The Company\u2019s customers include large and sophisticated users of bandwidth infrastructure, such as wireless service providers, telecommunications companies, financial services businesses, social networking, media, and web content companies, education, research and healthcare institutions, and governmental agencies.Market trends and driversThe demand for fiber connectivity is growing, driven by secular trends associated with fundamental shifts in both consumer and enterprise behaviors. There has been explosive growth in the proliferation of bandwidth intensive applications (e.g., cloud computing, remote data storage, over the top video streaming, social networking, etc.). Enterprises continue to migrate away from legacy networks towards reliable, high bandwidth fiber-centric networks in order to connect to discrete locations, data centers, and key locations within their organizations. Wireless carriers depend on fiber infrastructure providers to increase carriers\u2019 coverage and densification requirements, resulting in significantly increased demand for bandwidth infrastructure, specifically for fiber backhaul for existing 4G sites and upgrades for such sites to 5G. End users such as private enterprises (e.g., media/ content providers, financial institutions and hospital systems) and public sector entities (e.g., governmental agencies and school districts) are increasingly focused on digital transformations which have increased the amount of data they are trading in, thus increasing their need for reliable fiber network infrastructure. Fiber infrastructure providers such as Zayo are poised to benefit from these secular trends."
